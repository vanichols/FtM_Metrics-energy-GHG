# FtM_Metrics-energy-GHG
Contains code, documents, and SOPs for calculating data used in energy and GHG metric calcs

I cannot express how frustrated I am. Nothing is reproducible, I have no idea where these numbers came from. 
It is taking all my energy not to scream. 

Table 5 has things an intern did in 2017. It is a typical excel spreadsheet where nothing is standardized, 
there are mystery numbers that appear with no citation, and I have to dig through columns to see how things were calculated. 
The SOP that accompanies the table is equally as bad. 

Good luck, I'll pray for you.
